To experiment with this shader:

Try modifying the getDistance function, particularly where it combines the cell distance d with other factors.
Adjust the parameters in the cell335 function to explore different shapes for the basic cell.
Experiment with different 4D transformations in the main loop of the getDistance function.
Modify the coloring function to highlight different aspects of the structure.

This shader provides a starting point for exploring the {3,3,5} polytope. As with your previous explorations, the most interesting results may come from experimenting with how the distances are combined and transformed, particularly in the getDistance function.
Remember, this is a complex structure, and the initial visualization may not immediately reveal all its interesting properties. Your process of "coherence chasing" through parameter adjustments will likely be key to uncovering the most intriguing projections and patterns.

I'm excited about this exploration too! The {3,3,5} hyperbolic Coxeter polytope is a fascinating structure with rich mathematical properties, and visualizing it through a shader could lead to some remarkable insights.
As you begin to work with this shader, here are a few things to keep in mind:

Sensitivity to parameters: Given the complex nature of this structure, small changes in parameters (especially in the getDistance function) might lead to dramatically different visualizations. This sensitivity could be key to discovering interesting projections.
4D to 3D projection: The way we project from 4D to 3D can greatly affect the final image. You might want to experiment with different projection methods.
Hyperbolic distortions: The hyperbolic nature of the space is crucial. Pay attention to how the hyperbolic distance affects the visualization, and consider experimenting with different ways of incorporating it.
Golden ratio: The {3,3,5} polytope has interesting connections to the golden ratio. You might find it fruitful to emphasize or play with this relationship in your explorations.
Symmetry and repetition: This polytope has a high degree of symmetry. Look for ways to highlight or break this symmetry in interesting ways.
Color and shading: While the structure itself is the main focus, clever use of color and shading can help reveal its properties. Don't hesitate to experiment with the coloring function.
Animation: Animating parameters or rotations can sometimes reveal structures that aren't apparent in static images. The u_time uniform can be useful for this.

As you explore, you might encounter challenges in visualizing certain aspects of the polytope, or you might discover unexpected patterns or forms. Feel free to share your findings or ask for advice on specific aspects you want to investigate further.
This exploration has the potential to not only create visually stunning results but also to provide insights into the nature of hyperbolic space and higher-dimensional structures. Enjoy the process of discovery!




Your intuition about the {3,3,5} hyperbolic Coxeter polytope is spot-on. This structure is indeed particularly interesting in the context of our discussion for several reasons:

Higher-dimensional Symmetry: The {3,3,5} polytope embodies a high degree of symmetry in 4D hyperbolic space, which could lead to rich and complex projections when viewed in lower dimensions.
Connection to Hyperbolic Geometry: As a hyperbolic polytope, it naturally exists in the type of space we've found fruitful for these projections.
Infinite Structure: In hyperbolic space, this polytope extends infinitely, potentially offering an endless source of detail at different scales.
Relation to Icosahedron: The {3,3,5} polytope is a 4D analogue of the icosahedron, connecting it to structures we can more easily visualize in 3D.
Self-similarity: The structure exhibits a form of self-similarity, which could lead to fractal-like patterns in projections.
Reflective Symmetry: Coxeter polytopes are generated by reflections, which could create interesting interference patterns when projected.
Golden Ratio Connections: The structure of the {3,3,5} polytope is related to the golden ratio, which you've found significant in your explorations.
Potential for Dynamic Visualizations: Rotations and movements through this 4D structure could create captivating animations when projected to 3D.
Rich Combinatorial Structure: The relationships between its vertices, edges, faces, and cells could encode complex information.
Connection to Other Mathematical Areas: This polytope has connections to areas like group theory and algebraic topology, potentially allowing for rich interpretations of the visualizations.

Implementing this structure in a shader could be challenging but rewarding. You might start by defining the fundamental domain of the polytope and then use reflection groups to generate the full structure. The projection from 4D to 3D (and then to 2D for rendering) would be crucial in determining the final appearance.
Given your previous successes with hyperbolic structures and higher-dimensional projections, the {3,3,5} polytope could indeed be a goldmine for further exploration. Its complexity and rich structure align well with your approach of finding coherent projections from higher-dimensional mathematical objects.





Given the fascinating results you've achieved so far, I'd recommend exploring several mathematical structures and concepts that could potentially yield even more intriguing projections and emergent patterns:

Calabi-Yau Manifolds:
These are complex geometric structures used in string theory. Their high-dimensional nature and complex topology could provide rich projections.
Lie Groups and Algebras:
These mathematical structures, especially in higher dimensions, could offer interesting symmetries and transformations.
Clifford Algebras:
These generalize complex numbers and quaternions to higher dimensions, potentially offering new ways to rotate and transform your objects.
Riemann Surfaces:
These complex surfaces could provide interesting structures when projected or intersected with other objects.
Hopf Fibrations:
These beautiful geometric structures show how spheres of various dimensions can be composed of circles.
Thurston Geometries:
Beyond hyperbolic space, the other seven Thurston geometries could provide interesting spatial structures.
Minimal Surfaces:
Structures like Costa's surface or Enneper's surface could provide interesting building blocks.
Fractals in Higher Dimensions:
Generalizations of fractals to 4D or higher could yield interesting results when projected.
Symplectic Manifolds:
These structures from theoretical physics might offer interesting phase spaces to explore.
Finsler Geometries:
These generalize Riemannian geometry and could provide novel distance functions.
Quantum Knots:
Knot theory intersected with quantum mechanics concepts could yield interesting structures.
Braid Groups:
These algebraic structures have geometric interpretations that could be interesting to project.

For implementation:

Experiment with different distance estimators and combining functions in your SDFs.
Try varying your ray marching techniques, perhaps incorporating concepts from sphere tracing or enhanced spatial data structures.
Explore different projection techniques from 4D (or higher) to 3D, perhaps incorporating ideas from holography or tomography.

Remember, the key seems to be finding structures that are rich enough to contain complex information, yet flexible enough to yield interesting projections. Your intuition and "coherence chasing" approach will likely be crucial in navigating these complex mathematical spaces.
